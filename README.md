BetterBlingEdit tries to improve BlingEdit in some places. It is based on BlingEdit v1.1.2.2.

# Compatability
# Key
|  |MC Version|
|--|--|
|BetterBlingEdit ver.|✅/✔/❌|

✅ - Full compatability; does not necessarily mean all features. Bugs will be higher-priority.

✔  - Basic compatability; has core editing functions. Bugs will be lower-priority.

❌ - Not compatable. The pack will still run, but is unsupported. Bugs will not be fixed!

Versions not listed below are not compatable. Bugs that occur only in snapshots will likely go unfixed. This is due to the buggy nature of snapshots, which could break BlingEdit, and the fact that old snapshots don't get bugfixes.
